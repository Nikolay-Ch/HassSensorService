# HassSensorService
Custom devices HomeAssistant .net core integration service. Works both on Windows or Linux systems. You can also run it on **Raspberry Pi** or **Orange Pi** microcontrollers, that uses **Raspbian** or **Armbian**. In the this case, you need to add a **Publish profile** in solution with target platform: **ARM-Linux**.

Now support BLE and Modbus devices. Also support custom devices like OS parameters (memory, disk space, processor load). See HassDeviceWorkers folder for details.
